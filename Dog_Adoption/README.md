# Dog Adoption DataBase

* This project mimics the concept of a database for an adoption center of dogs. It was created in C++ using Qt for GUI. The app has two interfaces that can be accessed at its start, the administrator and the client side. The administrator can add, delete, and update the data. The client has the option of viewing all dogs and saving the ones they like to adopt. Every change is saved while using the app and also after it’s closed.

* The user has theoption of seeing their adotpion list as CSV file or a HTML file

* The user can go through the admin and user interface. All changes are propagated between the 2.
